orientation dance practice. This practice serves two purposes:
• Run-through for CNs who already know the dance and will perform
• Training for CNs who need to learn or refine the dance
Your Responsibilities:
• Train and support all CNs – Some CNs may not have fully learned the dance
yet. Provide clear instruction and encouragement to help them feel
confident.
• Supervise and organize the dancers – If necessary, select which CNs will
perform.
• Emphasize the purpose. The counselor orientation dance sets the tone for
orientation and helps participants feel connected, excited, and ready for a
week of fun.
• Be familiar with the dance. Know it well enough to teach the moves, spacing,
and timing effectively.
• Prepare the music. The song is available on the FSY laptop or iPads. Since the
main stage speakers will not be available, bring portable speakers.
• Plan staging and placement – Decide where dancers will be positioned.
Consider using:
o The stage
o The area in front of the stage
o The aisles (if space allows)
• Refine the performance – Ensure:
o Lines are straight
o Movements are synchronized
o Dancers are engaging and energetic
By creating a positive, enthusiastic dance experience, you help set the stage for a
successful orientation and an unforgettable FSY week."
